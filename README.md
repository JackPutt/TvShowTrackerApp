# Tv Show Tracker App 

## Overview
The goal of this app is to allow users to track the TV shows they have watched. A study has shown that users spend a lot of time watching the beginning of an episode before they realise they have seent it.

This React application connects to the IMDB API to serve the TV Series data, and then connects to a .NET Core Web API (TvShowTrackerAPI) for user authentication and persistance of series and episode information.
